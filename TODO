Features:

- No linkage between FlowSpecification and a physical exec plan. Make it happen, cap'n.
  -- add a SpecTransformer API that allows us to traverse the graph forawrds and/or backwards
     and emit the appropriate kind of output.

     ... this actually might just be a 'Visitor' pattern over the types of plan inputs.
     might need to rewrite the current "Visitor" class to be ASTVisitor instead,
     and also add a PlanVisitor.

    The local transformer should literally walk the graph (doing a reverse bfs) and convert
    node-for-node into local FE's and contexts.

    The remote version should generate a serialized form of the spec (e.g., in json).
    We'll then want to reconstruct that, somehow.


Things to Think About:

- Need to define threading model for physical operators. If we're using direct calls
  via the FlowExecutionContext, individual FlowElements can call emit() from multiple
  threads. We need to ensure that one FE's takeEvent() calls all happen in the same
  thread. Preferably, the same thread as open() and close() too.

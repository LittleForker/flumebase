Bugs:
  - Flume is super-chatty when you start it up locally. We should squash its logs,
    unless we're in debug mode.

  - We have no tests. This is hugely problematic.

Features:

  - Need ability to create a remote physical plan
  -- Need ability to run remote physical plan on a set of configured nodes.
  - Need a DROP FLOW operation
  - Need SHOW FLOWS operation
  - Need SHOW STREAMS, DROP STREAM
  - Need ability to auto-connect to a remote Flume resource.

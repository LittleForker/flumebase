Bugs:

- Parser can indicate that it hit an error but an EXPLAIN command can go on
  to produce a parse tree and exec plan for what it could parse. Make errors fatal. 
- If the parser encounters a parse tree it can't get started on, things crash.

Features:

- No linkage between FlowSpecification and a physical exec plan. Make it happen, cap'n.


Things to Think About:

- Need to define threading model for physical operators. If we're using direct calls
  via the FlowExecutionContext, individual FlowElements can call emit() from multiple
  threads. We need to ensure that one FE's takeEvent() calls all happen in the same
  thread. Preferably, the same thread as open() and close() too.

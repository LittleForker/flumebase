Bugs:


Features:

- No linkage between FlowSpecification and a physical exec plan. Make it happen, cap'n.


Things to Think About:

- Need to define threading model for physical operators. If we're using direct calls
  via the FlowExecutionContext, individual FlowElements can call emit() from multiple
  threads. We need to ensure that one FE's takeEvent() calls all happen in the same
  thread. Preferably, the same thread as open() and close() too.

FlumeBase is a Java application with a maven-based build process.

BUILD SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
  * Maven 2.0+
  * Java 1.6+
  * git
  * Linux, or other POSIX-like environment (e.g. cygwin)


INSTALLING PREREQUISITES:

The following prerequisite tools must be installed prior to building
FlumeBase:

  * Apache Thrift compiler 0.5.0
  * maven-thrift-plugin 0.1.10


  Installing Apache Thrift:

Apache Thrift can be downloaded from http://incubator.apache.org/thrift.
Download the 0.5.0 release of Thrift, untar it, and build it with
./configure && make && sudo make install.

Correct installation can be verified with the following commands:

  aaron@sailboat:~$ which thrift
  /usr/local/bin/thrift
  aaron@sailboat:~$ thrift -version
  Thrift version 0.5.0


  Installing the maven-thrift-plugin:

To integrate thrift in the Maven build, a specific plugin must be
downloaded from github.com/odiago/maven-thrift-plugin. Clone the
repository (git clone http://github.com/odiago/maven-thrift-plugin)
and run:

  cd path/to/maven-thrift-plugin
  git checkout maven-thrift-plugin-0.1.10
  mvn package
  mvn install:install-file -Dfile=target/maven-thrift-plugin-0.1.10.jar \
      -DpomFile=./pom.xml -Dpackaging=maven-plugin -Dversion=0.1.10



BUILDING FLUMEBASE:

Finally, build FlumeBase itself by changing to the FlumeBase source directory
(the directory containing this COMPILING.txt file) and running:

  mvn package

Unit tests can be executed by running:

  mvn test

More thorough (longer-running) integration tests are available at:

  mvn integration-test

The FlumeBase shell can be run with:

  bin/flumebase shell

                      Welcome to rtsql!


This system allows continuous and ad-hoc analysis of streaming event
data delivered by Flume.

rtsql will easily connect to existing Flume sources and allows users
to write SQL-based queries over these streaming data sets.

More documentation (in particular, a user guide explaining how to
configure rtsql, and the rtsql language) is available in the docs/
directory.
